This is new File 
I am wrirting here to check the Git Clone Command 
This command will clone the copy into local machine  from Central Repositroy 
vim command is used to enter the conent into file 
ls command is used to check the all files 
cat command is used to check the content of the file 

Doing the new Changes into File 
We need to undersand the difference between the Pull and Clone 
Clone will create directory into local Machine 
However pull is used when we have repository already available however, changes made into Central repository should reflect into Master branch should reflect here
